            <h3> Travelling in my life</h3>
            <p class="text-center"> Travelling abroad extends your horizons. Whether it's a well-earned holiday, a language course, or a business trip: it's exciting to see other parts of the world. You come into close contact with other cultures, get to know interesting people and experience new things. We help to make your stay abroad as carefree as possible.</p>
            <p class="text-center">Increasingly I like travelling together with my friends.Last spring we travelled to the city "Hotyn" and "Kamyanets-Podolsky". It's like a wonderful and amazing tour. The fortness "Hotyn" looks very great and powerful. Its height is 40 meters and beautiful landscapes. And the city "Kamyanets-Podolsky" looks excellent as well. There are the highest bridge in the Ukraine. The city "Kamyanets-Podolsky" has got a lot of amazing charch's and temples.</p>
            <p>It's some photos from this tour</p>
